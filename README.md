How to plot a generic Security Market Line using Python

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) has been a cornerstone of modern finance theory since its introduction. According to the CAPM, the expected return on an asset is determined by its beta (systematic risk), the risk-free rate, and the market risk premium.
E[R_i ]= R_f+ β_i (E[R_m ]-Rf)           

Where:
- R_f  signifies the risk-free rate of return,
- β_i  denotes the beta of security i,
- E[R_m ] represents the expected return on the market, and
- 〖(R〗_m- R_f) indicates the market premium.

We can directly visualize the CAPM postulates with his graphical representation, the Security Market Line (SML).

The SML is characterized by a linear relationship between beta and expected return. It starts from the risk-free rate on the y-axis, denoting the return of a risk-free investment. The slope of the SML represents the market risk premium, indicating the additional return investors require for bearing one unit of systematic risk. The point where the SML intersects the y-axis signifies the expected return of the market portfolio, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating investment opportunities.
Investments lying above the SML are considered undervalued, offering higher expected returns relative to their systematic risk. Conversely, investments below the SML are deemed overvalued, as they fail to provide adequate compensation for the level of risk assumed. By comparing individual investments to the SML, investors can assess whether they offer sufficient returns given their risk profile.
